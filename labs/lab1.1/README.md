## Build
For easy building, I recommend run the make command.

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./mycat.out file [FLAGS] [file2]

-c    --Copy from one file to other
```

A python script was used to test for time. So expect higher time values!
This comparation was done in a virtual machine using VMWare 15 using Lubuntu 18.10 64-bits, with 8 cores, 1 gb ram, and approx. 30-40% of real CPU usage.
